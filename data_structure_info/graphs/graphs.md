# Graphs

It consists of a group of vertices (or nodes) and set of edges that connect the two vertices. Vertices on the graph is represented as point or circles and edges are shown as arcs or line segments. An edge is represented by E(v,w) where v and w are the pairs of vertices. Removal of an edge from a circuit or connected graph creates a subgraph that is a tree.

Properties of a graph:
A vertex in a graph can be connected to any number of other vertices using edges.
An edge can be bidirected or directed.
An edge can be weighted.
In graph also we use various terms like adjacent vertices, path, cycle, degree, connected graph, complete graph, weighted graph, etc. Let’s understand some of these terms.

Adjacent vertices – A vertex a is adjacent to vertex b if there is an edge (a,b) or (b,a).
Path – A path from a random vertex w is an adjacent sequence of vertices.
Cycle – It is a path where the first and last vertices are the same.
Degree – It is a number of edges incident on a vertex.
Connected graph – If there exists a path from a random vertex to any other vertex, then that graph is known as a connected graph.

I feel like this includes a bunch of stuff
