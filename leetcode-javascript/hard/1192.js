// 1192. Critical Connections in a Network
// COME BACK TO: https://leetcode.com/problems/critical-connections-in-a-network/
// SOLVED? NO



// There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b] represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other server directly or indirectly through the network.

// A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server unable to reach some other server.

// Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

 

// Example 1:



// Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
// Output: [[1,3]]
// Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= n <= 10^5
// n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
// connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
// There are no repeated connections.
