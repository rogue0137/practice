## Hi! 

If you're coming to this repo because of [WWC](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) or another group I volunteer with, you probably need a quick overview of **"What's useful to me in this repo?"** Find it below!

You'll probably get the most out of the [data structure info](https://github.com/rogue0137/practice/tree/master/data_structure_info) section. 

The next most useful thing will probably be the [hundreds of leetcode problems I solved](https://github.com/rogue0137/practice/tree/master/leetcode_python) (some with explanations!). If you're confused about a particular solution and want more info, you can put in a request by contacting me [here](https://krysflores.com/#contact).

One day, I'm hoping to make the [System Design](https://github.com/rogue0137/practice/tree/master/system_design) section useful, but it's not there yet.

Lastly, I've done problems from other websites like Interview Cake, Udacity, Triplebyte, etc. I've put some of these problems in their respectively named folders. Many of these are incomplete and I don't intend to update them. If you find something useful there, awesome! If not, remember it's probably not getting updated. 

**Extra tidbit:** If you're transitioning into tech from another industry, [this](https://krysflores.com/#transition-into-tech) might also be a useful resource for you.
